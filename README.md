# 👋 Hi, I'm Hari Haran (aka realhariharan)

**Portfolio:** [realhariharan.live](https://realhariharan.live)

I'm a Computer Science Engineering (AI/ML) student who's obsessed with systems, infrastructure, and how power actually flows in the real world — not just apps and buzzwords.

**I don't just build features.**  
I build models of reality: supply chains, risk systems, automation pipelines, and AI tools that sit between software, policy, and physical infrastructure.

---

## 🔥 What I'm focused on

- Critical materials & supply-chain risk
- Energy, infrastructure, and geopolitics
- AI systems that explain, not hallucinate
- Automation over dashboards
- Building things that decision-makers actually use

I care more about **clarity than hype** and more about **leverage than vanity metrics**.

## 🧠 Core Skills

### Programming & Software
- **Python** – data pipelines, automation, ML, scraping
- **JavaScript / TypeScript**
- **SQL** – Postgres, SQLite
- **Git** – real usage, not just commits
- **Docker** – containerized services

### AI / ML
- Generative AI (LLMs)
- Prompt engineering (for real workflows, not demos)
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
- NLP pipelines
- Model evaluation & explainability
- Whisper / speech-to-text workflows

> I'm not chasing "AGI".  
> I'm building useful AI that plugs into systems.

### Data & Systems
- Data scraping & ingestion (Firecrawl, custom pipelines)
- ETL pipelines
- Risk scoring models
- Rule-based + AI-assisted decision systems
- Graph thinking (dependencies, choke points, cascades)

### Cloud & Infrastructure
- Google Cloud Platform (Vertex AI, storage, notebooks)
- AWS
- Firebase / Firestore
- Supabase
- CI/CD basics
- Linux-first mindset

### Frontend (when needed, not for fun)
- React.js
- Next.js
- Tailwind CSS
- Streamlit
- Neobrutalist, analyst-style UI (clarity > aesthetics)

## 🚀 Featured Project

### [Chokepoint](https://realhariharan.live/projects/chokepoint)
**Critical Materials Risk Intelligence Dashboard**

A neobrutalist, analyst-focused dashboard that maps structural supply-chain risk across critical metals like gallium, neodymium, lithium, cobalt, silicon, etc.

#### What it does
- Tracks supply concentration by country
- Maps industry dependency (semiconductors, EVs, defense, renewables)
- Flags choke points like export controls and refining dominance
- Computes explainable risk scores on-read
- Uses Firecrawl only for signals (policy + supply events), not noisy scraping

#### Why it exists
Most people don't know what breaks first when supply chains snap.  
This tool answers that clearly, without price charts or hype.

#### Tech stack
- React + Tailwind + shadcn/ui
- Supabase (Postgres + Edge Functions)
- Firecrawl
- SQL-computed risk logic

## 🧩 Other Interests

- Global infrastructure & energy systems
- Semiconductors & hardware supply chains
- Rare earths & critical minerals
- Financial systems & market structure
- Psychology and decision-making
- Building things from scratch (software + physical systems)

## 🧠 How I think

| Principle | Over |
|-----------|------|
| Systems | Tools |
| Structure | Prediction |
| Clarity | Complexity |
| Leverage | Effort |

I'm more interested in **why things fail** than why they work.

---

## 📍 What I'm looking for

✅ Research roles  
✅ Infra / climate / policy-adjacent startups  
✅ AI systems roles  
✅ Environments where people care about second-order effects

❌ Not interested in:
- Copy-paste SaaS
- Meaningless dashboards
- "AI" slapped on CRUD apps
